![Todo Logo](https://github.com/fdgenie/Todo/blob/master/todo-frontend/Todo_frontend/public/icons/32x32.png)
A simple todo app made by TypegraphQL in the back end and Vuejs + Quasar in the front end

:trophy: The main reason for this app is to dip my toe in the water in TypegrapgQL as i find it very interesting, and what better way to start than a CRUD Todo app.

:notebook: There are instructions of how to get this app going in your enviroment in each folder.
